            <h2>Hi, let me introduce myself,</h2>
            <p>I'm mainly a software developer with an electrical engineering background. Using my skills to help other
                people is what I love to do. </p>
            <p>I believe there is a solution for every problem. That's the main inspiration for most software/products I
                create.
                I also like to explore new things and concepts. </p>
            <p>Besides software, I have knowledge/experience with sound engineering, church technology (sound,
                projection, streaming), electrical engineering, video creating/editing, and education.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>You can get in touch with me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-anton-jansen/"

            <p>Currently, all my software is free and most of them is open source. Some of my projects (see below) are
                used by hundreds or thousands of people for free. As no profit is made, these projects depend fully on
                donations. If you want to contribute or show your thanks, please consider donating by: </p>

                Below I've listed just a small fraction of my projects. Most of my projects aren't targeting a large
                audience or aren't meant for public use (like the electronic cruise control I made), hence they are not
                listed below.
